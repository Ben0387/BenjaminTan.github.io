                    The KFC Yum! Center is a multi-purpose sports arena in Downtown Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It is named after the KFC restaurant chain and Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC. Adjacent to the Ohio River waterfront, it is located on Main Street
                    between 2nd and 3rd Streets and opened on October 10, 2010. The arena is part of a $450 million project that includes a 975-car parking structure and floodwall. The Louisville Cardinals men's and women's basketball teams from the University
                    of Louisville are the primary tenants of the arena complex. The U of L women's volleyball team began using the arena as a part-time home in 2011, and made the arena its main home in 2012. With 22,090 seats for basketball, it is the
                    largest arena in the United States by seating capacity designed primarily for basketball, and the second-largest used for college basketball, behind the Carrier Dome at Syracuse University, a venue built to house football and lacrosse
                    in addition to basketball. The arena's current attendance record for a sporting event is 22,815, set March 9, 2013, against Notre Dame (men's basketball). The current attendance record for any event is 23,085, set March 9, 2019, when
                    Metallica played their WorldWired Tour. From April to May 2021, it was home to the Louisville Xtreme of the Indoor Football League, but they were voted out of the league after five games.
